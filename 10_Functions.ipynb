    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions help in code reuse and modularization. Once a function is written and tested, it can be used as a black box. All you need to know about the function in order to use it is its interface, which consists of:\n",
    "1. Name of the function\n",
    "1. Its input parameters\n",
    "1. Its output parameters\n",
    "1. What the function does\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the user of the function need not know how the function does what it is supposed to be doing, the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the designer and implementer of the function must know how the function does what it is supposed to do. Thus, the designer of the function you must pay careful attention to designing its interface as much as to the algorithm. In addition, a good practice while designing functions is to ensure that a functionn does only only one thing, but it does it well. The definition of what that **\"one thing\"** is can be subjective. A typical approach, in procedural programming approach is to see if the task to be achieved by a function can be sub-divided into simpler tasks. If that is possible, it must be sub-divided and each sub-task must be a function by itself. This must be done with each new function that needs to be implemented and you must stop either when it is not possible to further sub-divide a function or if you feel it is not worthwhile. You will end up with a hierarchy of functions beginning with the most complex at the top and ending with the most simplest at the bottom. Once this is achieved, writing a function at any one level involves putting together the right combination and sequence of one or more lower level functions tied together with program flow control structures such as loops or branching.\n",

    "## Function to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "A quadratic equation has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It has two roots, $x_1$ and $x_2$, which can be either real numbers or imaginary numbers. If the discriminant $d = b^2 - 4ac$ is zero or positive, the roots are real and if it is less than zero, the roots are imaginary. Further, if the discriminant is zero, the roots are real and equal, that is $x_1 = x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case the roots are real, they are given by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_1 = \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a};  \\qquad x_2 = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In case the roots are imaginary:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_1 = -\\frac{b}{2a} - i \\, \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}; \\qquad x_1 = -\\frac{b}{2a} - i \\, \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 + 4ac}}{2a} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Interface\n",
    "**Name of the function** must reflect its purpose and must be as short as possible. In Python, names of functions are in lowercae by convention and to use underscore (**`_`**) to separate words if the name consists of multiple words. Let us choose the name of our function as **`quadratic_roots()`**. Other options could be **`roots()`** but it is too short and does not indicate roots of what. Another choice could be **`qroots()`** or **`quad_roots()`**. Let us go with **`quadratic_roots()`** even if it is a little long because it refelcts its purpose well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input parameters** represent the objects that are input to the function when it is called. In our case, this is dependent on the problem we are solving. Since a quadratic equation has three coefficients, the choice is straight forward. The input parameters are $a$, $b$ and $c$, the coefficients of $x^2$, $x$ (actually $x^1$) and the constant ($x^0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output parameters** are the two roots of the quadratic equation, namely $x_1$ and $x_2$. They can either be real numbers or imaginary numbers. At present, we will decide not to calculate the roots if they are imaginary and instead return an error condtion. We will calculate the roots only if they are real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is out first implementation."
