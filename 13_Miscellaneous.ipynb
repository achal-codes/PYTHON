    "Python is well known for the large number of packages available to do a broad range of programming. The phrase **\"batteries included\"** is used by the Python community to indicate that there is a package to do almost anything. It has very powerful built-in packages for several useful applications. A comprehensive list is available here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html. Some examples are:\n",
    "1. **`re`** for **regular expression** operations. Very useful for string pattern matching, searching and replacing.\n",
    "1. **`datetime`** for date and time operations.\n",
    "1. **`itertools`** and **`functools`** for functional programming support.\n",
    "1. **`pathlib`** for an object oriented filesystem paths.\n",
    "1. **`os.path`** for comman pathname manipulations.\n",
    "1. **`zipfile`** for working with ZIP archives.\n",
    "1. **`csv`** for reading and writing CSV files.\n",
    "1. **`asyncio`** for asynchronous I/O.\n",
    "1. **`1socket`** for low-lvevel networking interface.\n",
    "1. **`email`** an email and MIME handling package.\n",
    "1. **`http.server`** for writing simple HTTP servers.\n",
    "1. **`venv`** for creating and managing virtual environments.\n",
    "1. **`abc`** abstract base classes in OO programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the built-in packages, there are a large number of third-party packages, distributed through PyPI for a large number of application areas. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HTML Requests, Web Scraping and Web Crawling:**\n",
    "    - [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/index.html)\n",
    "    - [ScraPy](https://scrapy.org/)\n",
    "1. **Web application frameworks:** \n",
    "    * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a **batteries included** web app framework.\n",
    "    * [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) is a microframework with the programmer having to add any feature required. But there are a large number of plug-ins that provide additional features.\n",
    "    * [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) is a powerful framework that has good built-in features.\n",
    "    * [Sanic](https://sanicframework.org/en/) is similar to Flask with support for **asynchronous** programming.\n",
    "1. **Machine Learning and Data Science:**\n",
    "    * [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) provides powerful n-dimensional array data structure and operators and algorithms \n",
    "    * [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) provides powerful numerical computation algorithms\n",
    "    * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) provides the panel data structure with poerful data analysis and manipulation tools\n",
    "    * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) provides graphical plotting functions for data visualization.\n",
    "    * [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is a machine learning package for Python.\n",
    "    * [keras](https://keras.io/) is a deep learning API for Python.\n",
    "    * [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs.\n",
    "1. **REST API Frameworks:**\n",
    "    - [fastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a high-performance framework to build REST APIs.\n",
    "    - [hug](https://github.com/hugapi/hug) is a framework that simplifies Python API development.\n",
    "1. **Desktop GUI Frameworks:**\n",
    "    - [PyQt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro/) is a framework to develop GUI applications for the desktop.\n",
    "    - [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/) is a cross-platform framework to develop GUI applications for the desktop."

    "## Regular Expressions with `re`\n",

    "We will do the following:\n",
    "1. Define a pattern to be used for matching or searchine.\n",
    "1. Check if a given string matches the defined pattern.\n",
    "1. Split the matching string into sub-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us use the VTU University Seat Number as an example. You are aware that VTU USN is a 10 character string with the following pattern: NCCYYBBXXX where:\n",
    "1. **N** is a digit between 1 and 4, indicating the region.\n",
    "1. **CC** are two alphabets representing the college code.\n",
    "1. **YY** are two digits indication the last two digits of the year of admission. Note that the year 2000 is 00 and 1999 is 99.\n",
    "1. **BB** are two alphabets representing the branch. For example, CS is Computer Science and Engineering.\n",
    "1. **XXX*** are three digits representing the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string, we wish to verify whether it matches this pattern, and if it does, we would like to split it into the 5 components, namely, region, college code, year of admission, branch and number."
